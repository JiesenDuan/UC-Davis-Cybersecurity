CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CYBER SLEUTH THAT FINDS THIS MESSAGE!!


    My Confession

     I, Detective Tannen, am confessing that I am the Alphabet Bandit! 

     I am the one solely responsible for all of the Hill Valley Break-ins.

     Since I wasn't promoted to Captain, I have been determined to cause havoc to the Hill Valley community and tie up the Hill Valley Resources.

     Unfortunately, since you have found this message, I will assume that I will be prosecuted and the break-ins will cease.

    Sincerely,
     Detective Tannen
